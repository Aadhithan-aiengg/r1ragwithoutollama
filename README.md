# r1ragwithoutollama
the code that runs r1 in colab and works in free tier of google colab

Disclaimer:
I ran this code in t4 gpu and it works very fast and got best results. When I used cpu mode, it took a long time without a sign of completion. Used 1.5b r1 distilled model. Address any issue if encountered. Improvements and Criticism are welcome.
